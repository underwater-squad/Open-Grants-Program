## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview

Please provide the following:
  * A brief description: Permissionless Value Exchange Protocol based on Substrate
  * Integration: AMM (Automated Market Making) DEX (Decentralized Exchange) for native substrate tokens
  * Background: Team has been de-fi power users on Ethereum/Tron and would like to develop new defi primitive modules for Substrate. Starting with a permissionless swap mechanism for Substrate-based tokens ($DOT for $KLP) & easier/faster/cheaper DEX experience. 

### Project Details 
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.

Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
* Mockups/designs of any UI components: https://github.com/underwater-squad/subswap, https://github.com/underwater-squad/subswap-frontend
* API specifications of the core functionality: TBA
* An overview of the technology stack to be used: Rust - backend, Javascript - Front-end 
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture etc. to be deployed: TBA
* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic: Update with Chainlink hackathon submission TBA 

### Ecosystem Fit 
Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?: 
- https://www.polkastarter.com/ -  exists on the Sora Network & focused on cross-chain interoperability- wBTC or ETH assets while we are focused first on substrate-native assets. 
- https://github.com/Polkadex-Substrate/Documentation - written in Python

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone. 

For each milestone:
* Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of detail must be enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
* Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project. 
* Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project
* **Full-time equivalent (FTE):**  Workload of an employed person ([see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent)) 
* **Total Costs:** Amount of Payment in BTC for the whole project. The total amount of funding needs to be below $30k at the time of submission.

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Substrate Modules 
* **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  1
* **Costs:** 0.75 BTC

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests | 
| 1. | Substrate module: X | We will create a Substrate module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the first milestone) |  
| 2. | Substrate module: Y | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 3. | Substrate module: Z | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 4. | Substrate chain | Modules X, Y & Z of our custom chain will interact in such a way... (Please describe the deliverable here as detailed as possible) |  
| 5. | Docker | We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the full functionality of our chain |

### Milestone 2 Example — Additional features

### Community engagement

As part of the Program, we require that you produce an article/tutorial and publish it (for example on [Medium](https://medium.com/)). It should explain your work done as part of the grant. 

Normally, we ask you to submit the write-up upon the completion of your grant, although for larger projects it might make sense to publish multiple articles after the completion of different milestones.

## Future Plans
Please include the team's long-term plans and intentions.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign: 
Any additional information that you think is relevant to this application that hasn't already been included.

Possible additional information to include:
* What work has been done so far?
* Are there are any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?
* Have you applied for other grants so far?
